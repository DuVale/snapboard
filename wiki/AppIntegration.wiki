 This doc will help get you started with integrating Snapboard into your existing django project.  This will only cover snapboard and n

1. Moved the snapboard app directory into django projects directory.


2. Added the appropriate url mappings to url.py.  A good example would be:

{{{
    # forums
    (r'^forum/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
    (r'^forums/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
}}}


3. In settings.py, you need to add the following:

 * Add snapboard to installed apps variable.

 * Add the following variables:

{{{
    SNAP_PREFIX = '/forums'
    SNAP_MEDIA_PREFIX = MEDIA_URL + '/media'
}}}

 * For url mappings, add the following line to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS variable:

{{{
    'webapps.snapboard.views.snapboard_default_context',
}}}

4. Sync'd up the db.

5. Run a local server via manage.py runserver.

Logged in, hit the forum link and it worked like a charm.

All in all, good experience with getting the app integrated into my
site.  Next steps will be to get the media files installed into my
environment so that it looks pretty.  I'll let you know how that goes.
