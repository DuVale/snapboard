This doc will help get you started with integrating Snapboard into your existing django project.  For comments, questions and concerns, please see the Google [http://groups.google.com/group/snapboard-discuss Group].


1. Move the snapboard app directory into your django projects directory.


2. Added the appropriate url mappings to url.py.  A good example would be:

{{{
    # forums
    (r'^forum/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
    (r'^forums/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
}}}


3. In settings.py, you need to do the following:

 * Add snapboard to installed apps variable.

 * Add the following variables:

{{{
    SNAP_PREFIX = '/forums'
    SNAP_MEDIA_PREFIX = MEDIA_URL + '/media'
}}}
   
   These manage the url mappings inside the views and templates.

 * To make sure that the two SNAP variables get processed correctly, you need to add the following line to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS variable:

{{{
    'webapps.snapboard.views.snapboard_default_context',
}}}

4. Sync'd up the db.

5. Run a local server via manage.py runserver.

At this point, you should be able to log in and play around with the app.  Have fun.
