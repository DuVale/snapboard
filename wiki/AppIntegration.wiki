This doc will help get you started with integrating Snapboard into your existing django project.  For comments, questions and concerns, please see the Google [http://groups.google.com/group/snapboard-discuss Group].


1. Move the snapboard app directory into your django projects directory.


2. Added the appropriate url mappings to url.py.  A good example would be:

{{{
    # forums
    (r'^forum/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
    (r'^forums/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
}}}


3. In settings.py, you need to do the following:

 * Add snapboard to installed apps variable.

 * Add the following variables:

{{{
    SNAP_PREFIX = '/forums'
    SNAP_MEDIA_PREFIX = MEDIA_URL + '/media'
}}}
   
   These manage the url mappings inside the views and templates.

 * To make sure that the two SNAP variables get processed correctly, you need to add the following line to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS variable:

{{{
    'webapps.snapboard.views.snapboard_default_context',
}}}

4. Sync'd up the db.

5. Run a local server via manage.py runserver.

Logged in, hit the forum link and it worked like a charm.

All in all, good experience with getting the app integrated into my
site.  Next steps will be to get the media files installed into my
environment so that it looks pretty.  I'll let you know how that goes.
