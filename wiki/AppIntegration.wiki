This doc will help get you started with integrating Snapboard into your existing django project.

1. Moved the snapboard app directory into my projects directory.

I won't be using sbreg initially, as I hit upon the same blog post
it's based off of and I have my own version of a registration module.
After looking at sbreg, there's little difference right now between
the two.

2. Added the following to my project urls.py:

{{{
    # forums
    (r'^forum/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
    (r'^forums/', include('webapps.snapboard.urls')),
}}}

Catching both urls makes sense based upon previous experience running
forums.  People always muddle up the url and either add or remove the
s.

3. Added snapboard to installed apps.

4. Sync'd up the db.

There's a bug when you sync up and you answer no to populating the
test data into the db.  I'll file a bug in a few with a patch.

5. Run a local server via manage.py runserver.

Logged in, hit the forum link and it worked like a charm.

All in all, good experience with getting the app integrated into my
site.  Next steps will be to get the media files installed into my
environment so that it looks pretty.  I'll let you know how that goes.
