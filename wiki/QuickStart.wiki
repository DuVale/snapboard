#summary Get up and running
Because snapboard runs on the Django framework, a host of installation options (database selection, CGI/mod_python, etc) are available.  This document does not attempt to be a comprehensive guide on all the options available to you to run snapboard.  For that, a careful reading of the [http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install/ Django installation document] is a good start.

[http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ServerArrangements Common server arrangements] are covered on the Django Wiki.

= Test Driving SNAPboard =
An example site is included in.  If you have Django and sqlite3 installed already, you can test-drive snapboard by simply running Django's built-in web server:

If you use MySQL or PostgreSQL, simply tweak `examplsite.settings`

When you run `syncdb` on the examplesite, you have the option of seeding the forum with garbage threads and posts.

{{{
$ cd /PATH/TO/SNAPBOARD
$ cd examplesite
$ python manage.py syncdb
$ python manage.py runserver
}}}

SNAPboard will install a temporary database at `/tmp/examplesite.db`.  If you use MySQL or PostgreSQL, simply tweak `examplsite.settings`.

Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/snapboard to see it in action!
