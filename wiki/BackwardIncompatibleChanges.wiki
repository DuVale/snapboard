#summary This page lists backward incompatible changes in SNAPboard's development trunk

= Revision 182 =

  * As of r182, integrated registration and user profile have disappeared. These may be available again soon. 

  * The middleware classes for User and IP address bans are now 'snapboard.middleware.ban.IPBanMiddleware' and 'snapboard.middleware.ban.!UserBanMiddleware'.
  The models to support those bans have changed.

  * The !SnapboardProfile model has been changed to !UserSettings, which only holds the user's preferences for board navigation.

  * The SNAP_PREFIX setting has disappeared in favor of the more flexible named urls (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/#id2).
